# DonanaAcousticModel

Python scripts for bird species classification from audio recordings. This work is focused on species frequently observed in the Do√±ana Biological Reserve (Spain) - available [here](Data/SpeciesList.txt).

## Code

### Models

Output folder with trained models. Model names follow this notation: `<CNN>-<resolution>-<n_labels>-<extra>`, where `wi` stands for *weight imprinting*, `ft` for *fine-tuning* and `q` for *quantized*. 

### Data

Species list employed in this work.

### Testing

- `analyze-audios.py`: end-to-end utility to load a trained model and evaluate it on audio files, producing classification results.

Example execution (see example prediction file `example-predictions.txt`):

```python analyze-audios.py --i <audiofolder> --o <predictionsfolder> --min_conf 0.5```


```
cat example-predictions.txt 
0.0     3.0     Bubo bubo       1.00    113954.mp3
6.0     9.0     Bubo bubo       1.00    113954.mp3
12.0    15.0    Ardea cinerea   0.97    113954.mp3
15.0    18.0    Bubo bubo       1.00    113954.mp3
```

### Embedded inference

- `analyze-audios-tflite.py`: end-to-end utility to load a trained model in TensorFLow Lite format, producing classification results.

Same prediction file is produced (`example-predictions.txt`)

### Notebooks

- `example-analyze-tflite.ipynb`: example of loading a trained model and evaluate it an audio file, showing classification results.
