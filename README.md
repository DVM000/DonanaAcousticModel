# DonanaAcousticModel

Python scripts for training bird species classification models from audio recordings. This work is focused on species frequently observed in the Do√±ana Biological Reserve (Spain).


## Code

### Segmentation

Scripts for segmenting audio files into fixed-length chunks and converting them into spectrograms. Supports multiple segmentation and spectrogram generation methods.

- `preprocess.py`: main script to split audio and generate spectrograms.


### BirdNet

Adapted BirdNET scripts for running species classification and segmentation on raw audio.

- `setup_birdnet.py`: script to install the employed version of BirdNET.
- `execute_birdnet_segment_save.py.`: script for automatically running the BirdNET analysis + segmentation on subfolders. This provides
 BirdNET .txt tables, BirdNET's prediction logits, and extracted segments.

### Training

Scripts for training DNN models on the spectrogram dataset.

- `train_distill.py`: script to train a model using transfer learning from ImageNet or knowledge distillation from BirdNET's logits.
- `utils.py`: Helper functions for data loading, training, and evaluation.

### Models

Output folder with trained models.

### Data

Species list employed in this work.

### Testing

- `analyze-audios.py`: end-to-end utility to load a trained model and evaluate it on audio files, producing classification results.

Example execution (see example prediction file `example-predictions.txt`):

```python analyze-audios.py --i <audiofolder> --o <predictionsfolder> --min_conf 0.5```
